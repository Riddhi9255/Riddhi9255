Question:1
 Write a c++program using cin and cout 

To enter two numbers and find their sum :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
cout<<riddhi memdavadi;
cout<<220130318035;

int first_number, second_number, sum;
   
cout << "Enter two integers: ";

  cin >> first_number >> second_number;

 // sum of two numbers in stored in variable         

sum = first_number + second_number;


 
 cout << first_number << " + " <<  second_number << " = " << sum;     

 return0;


Output :
Enter two integers: 4
5
4 +5=9
