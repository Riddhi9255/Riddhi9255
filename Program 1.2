Question 2:
Write a c++ program to perform all arithmatic operations : 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
main() {
   cout<<riddhi memdavadi;
   cout<<220130318035;
   int a = 21;
   int b = 10;
    int c ;

       
   c = a + b;
   cout << "Line 1 - Value of c is :" << c << endl ;
   c = a + b;
   cout << "Line 2 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl ;  
   c = a - b;
   cout << "Line 3 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl ;
   c = a * b;
   cout << "Line 4 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl ;
      c = a % b;
cout << "Line 5 - Value of c is  :" << c << endl ;
    return 0;
}
Output:
Line 1 - Value of c is :31
Line 2 - Value of c is  :11
Line 3 - Value of c is :210
Line 4 - Value of c is  :2
Line 5 - Value of c is  :1
